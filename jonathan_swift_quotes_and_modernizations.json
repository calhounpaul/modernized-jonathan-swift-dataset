Now human nature is so constituted that we can never pursue anything heartily but upon hopes of a reward. If we run a race, it is in expectation of a prize; and the greater the prize the faster we run; for an incorruptible crown, if we understand it and believe it to be such, more than a corruptible one.",

This oversight led to numerous challenges, and the reasons for these difficulties cannot be easily explained; material possessions, while satisfying physical needs, do not provide lasting fulfillment for the mind. Moreover, they are not exclusive to the wise and virtuous, as they can be obtained through ignorance or immoral means. Human nature is wired such that we can only pursue things with genuine enthusiasm when we anticipate a reward. For instance, when we participate in a race, it is with the hope of winning a prize; the more valuable the prize, the more vigorously we compete. An incentive that is both incorruptible and meaningful is more effective than one that is fleeting and corruptible."

He raised, with much difficulty and public discontent, the largest tax ever imposed in England; and, accompanied by his nephew Theobald, crossed into Normandy with a powerful army. The King of France, who had hoped to conquer the duchy before his enemy arrived, confidently marched towards the Normandy border; however, upon seeing an enemy force of equal size and strength, he abruptly halted his progress. The two armies faced off for several hours, neither side willing to engage in battle; the rest of the day was spent in minor skirmishes, with the French launching occasional attacks that were met with varying success. The remaining days of the year passed without any significant actions being taken."

The common critics of the Church do not deny this, instead focusing on the Church's supposed insatiable desire for power and wealth, which is a common trait among all groups and individuals alike.

Cromwell's notion upon this article was natural and right; when, upon the surrender of a town in Ireland, the Popish governor insisted upon an article for liberty of conscience, Cromwell said, he meddled with no man's conscience; but, if by liberty of conscience, the governor meant the liberty of the mass, he had express orders from the Parliament of England against admitting any such liberty at all.",

Oliver Cromwell had a wise perspective on this issue when he refused to allow the Popish governor in Ireland to include an article for religious freedom in the surrender terms. Cromwell believed that individuals should be free to practice their own faith without interference, but he drew the line at granting collective liberty of conscience, as that would have gone against the explicit orders of the English Parliament."

This fear of being excluded has likely given rise to the profession of criticism, and has provided fuel for their secret detractors to claim that a true critic is nothing more than a skilled artisan with a modest investment, comparable to a tailor. Moreover, the notion that a critic's commonplace book is akin to the \"Tailor's Hell\" and their wit and knowledge are displayed through the use of a goose, serves as a humorous analogy to highlight the perceived limitations of this profession."

Pursuant to these intentions, he soon found an occasion for a quarrel: expostulating with Henry, that he had broken his promise by not doing homage for the Duchy of Normandy, as well as by neglecting to raze the castle of Gisors, which was built on the French side of the river Epte, the common boundary between both dominions.",

Louis became wary of King Henry's growing power and influence in the region, and he began to secretly plot against him. He saw an opportunity to gain control of Normandy or at least create a faction within the kingdom that would support his own interests. To achieve this goal, Louis fabricated a reason for conflict: he accused Henry of breaking their agreement by failing to do homage for the Duchy of Normandy and neglecting to demolish the castle of Gisors, which was built on the French side of the river Epte, the shared border between their territories."

For the brain in its natural position and state of serenity disposeth its owner to pass his life in the common forms, without any thought of subduing multitudes to his own power, his reasons, or his visions, and the more he shapes his understanding by the pattern of human learning, the less he is inclined to form parties after his particular notions, because that instructs him in his private infirmities, as well as in the stubborn ignorance of the people.",
