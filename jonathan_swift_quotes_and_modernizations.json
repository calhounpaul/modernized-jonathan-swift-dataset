On the other hand, the opposing party, still bitter and idle since their downfall, employs a team of writers who produce numerous defamatory materials to support their cause. The writers are skillful in employing various defamatory tactics and have a writing style that appeals to the general public. Those who wish to write in support of their prince and country are discouraged by the high tax for publications, as its cost exceeds the value of both the materials and the work.

If you're going to bed and have used the toilet, you can dip the candle's end into the toilet. Spitting on your hand and squeezing the wax until it goes out is another method. The cook can put out the candle by placing it in a bowl of flour, oats, hay, or litter. The housemaid can extinguish her candle by running it against a mirror, which is an effective way to clean the mirror.
