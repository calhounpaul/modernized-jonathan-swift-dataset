It took me an hour to walk to the end of this field, which was enclosed by a tall hedge that reached at least one hundred and twenty feet into the air. The trees were so tall that I could not estimate their height. There was a stile to cross from this field into the next. It had four steps, with a large stone to climb over when you reached the top step.

The love we have for ourselves, is to be the pattern of that love we ought to have toward our neighbour; but as the copy doth not equal the original, so my neighbour cannot think it hard, if I prefer myself, who am the original, before him, who is only the copy. Thus, if any matter equally concern the life, the reputation, the profit of my neighbour and my own; the law of nature, which is the law of God, obligeth me to take care of myself first, and afterward of him.",

Our love for ourselves should serve as the model for our love of others, but it cannot be as intense as the original. If a situation affects equally the life, reputation, or profit of my neighbor and myself, the law of nature, which is the law of God, dictates that I must look out for myself first, and then for him."

Meanwhile the trader, the farmer, and the shopkeeper, complain of the hardness and deadness of the times, and wonder whence it comes; while it is, in a great measure, owing to their own folly, for want of that love of their country, and public spirit and firm union among themselves, which are so necessary to the prosperity of every nation.",

Meanwhile, the trader, the farmer, and the shopkeeper complain about the hard times and wonder why things are so difficult, while it is largely due to their own shortsightedness, due to their lack of a sense of patriotism and collective unity, which are crucial for any nation's prosperity."

A brewer gives a bribe to have the privilege of selling drink to the Navy; but the fraud is ten times greater than the bribe, and the public is at the whole loss.",
        "modernized": "In a state, it's the same thing. An avaricious individual in government is in league with the entire clan of their district or jurisdiction, which in contemporary terms means, \"To live and let live.\" Yet, their personal gains are the smallest part of the public's losses. Give a guinea to a cunning land-waiter, and they'll turn a blind eye to the merchant's cheating of the Queen. A brewer bribes to have the privilege of selling drink to the Navy, but the fraud is far greater than the bribe, and the public bears the entire cost."

That minister was galbet, or admiral of the realm, very much in his master's confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose and sour complexion. However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.",
